        <h1>Ego !_!</h1>
        <p> A lot of us humans would like to think we're really different but a lot of us aren't really that different and one of the universal traits that all humans have is ego. Ego is your self-concept how you view yourself your name what you wear how you act what you listen to your whole essence essentially and it's arbitrary because your ego is it's something you've made up and constructed not just you of course I mean you you've been open influenced by our environment people you hang out with things like that okay so you were born where you were born at let's say you're born in the United States and then but let's say in this timeline you were adopted to like an Indian family you're adopted to an Indian family and then you grew up in India that version you'll be completely different from the version of you that grew up in the United States now you look the same but your but your beliefs how you dress how you speak the languages you speak how you act mannerisms they be completely different I mean your even your you'd be in a different system I mean the United States it's like capitalistic whereas in India some people still practice caste system but I'm saying your ego would be different so essentially it's something that's constructed and your sense of self there's definitely good places for it and kind of times where you need to understand if it's getting in your what getting in your way a lot of people they like to keep their sense of self and which is good I mean you want to have a sense of self but I'm saying you want to be open to other perspectives and learn from from other people that way you can grow and even understand yourself better in the long run I have a story uh this was two days ago I was going to the store I was getting something at the store and you know cuz this whole covid stuff you have to wear a face mask I forgot my face mask at home so I just went in the store while I was walking there I was oh oh I forgot my face mask well you know what let me just get some real quick and then we like it's all good you know I get in there and I'm and I get my thing and then the security guard sees me he's like oh you know you can't be in here without a face mask I was like I mean I'm just getting something for like 30 seconds it's not that big of a deal you know I was in an in I'm out you know you know I'm out I'm quick with it nice shot quick with it but he was like no you can't do that you have to leave and I just looked at him I was like you serious right now like I got to leave I have to leave right now I'm literally getting something for real quick and I but I have to leave up to drive all the way back home just to get this mask and then come back just to buy this thing and I was kind of a little annoyed I was annoyed when I was walking out that store and I was getting back in the car and then it kind of hitting me I was like wait a second I had a pause for a second because at that moment I was completely immersed in my agenda right I was immersed in what I wanted to happen I wanted to go in there and get my stuff and then leave I didn't take an account that there are rules to this establishment there are rules to a store especially during these times for the safety of everybody else even if I don't have it if even if I don't have that virus to coat the corona virus they don't know that and they need to make things as safe as possible because you know people are getting sick out here so I was too enthralled in my ego and my sense of self my agenda that I didn't see the bigger picture in that moment and I caught myself really quickly but that's not but the average person will not catch themselves when they're in their ego and they're not they're only you know immersed in their agenda oftentimes we miss it because we're just not aware enough we don't we don't look ourselves objectively we like to think that we're always on the right on at all times because that's what the ego demands like it wants to feel it wants to feel like it's right all the time and you know logically you know you're supposed to wear a face mask but I paint and I can't understand that logic only really concerns the ego when it's in its favor a Seth or a party and I rent out a venue for it and I've been you can only hold in 500 people logically the 500 and first person that comes in I have to kick them out cuz logically that makes sense there's going hold 500 people you can't come boom right it's in my favor but if I'm that person that gets kicked out I'm going to get mad because I wanted to be in that party and I didn't understand that the capacity of it is 500 people you see how that's funny we can't see the other side ego has to feel right all the time you can't necessarily do something that you know is bad and feel good about it you know what I mean . Hitler the leader of the Nazi Party back in the world war in World War 2 Hitler had strong ideas about how the world worked and how the human race was supposed to be how everyone should how there's one you know great race which is the Aryan people ideally having blond hair and blue eyes and gypsies Jews and blacks they they they're not there they're low they're low on the race-scale according to him and this was a strong belief in him and he really you know use propaganda to have people of Germany really fall into that thought process it was it was it was a belief that he really pushed in the schools and the newspapers all that and you know people bought into it after World War one Germany was in bad shape economically so they needed a leader and Hitler used propaganda to really get people together and really fall into it and you know you know through propaganda and repetition the subconscious mind will start believing anything and that's people start doing they started believing that Jews are bad and that you know there's a select few people there's a there's a race that's in the top hierarchy of people as as wrong as in as ridiculous as I sounds to us to the Nazi Party that was a belief and they believed that there were right they believed that they were the good guys looking back we can say that that's ridiculous but they don't see it that way it's it's all perspective and with everybody believing in Hitler peep the more people believe in something the more of a like social someone the more social proof it gets right you mean you see this everywhere like the the more popping something is the more the more people like something the more people like something because a lot of people like it so it must be good that's just an assumption it's called I think in psychology they call it the social proof tendency it's a it's a cognitive bias one of the 25 cognitive biases but I mean and you could and it's so easy for you to say oh you know well I wonder fallen into that propaganda I'm a critical thinker right now I'm sure there's some propaganda that you fall into there's some fake news on social media or on television that you fall prey to when you see it and you believe it hundred-percent when in reality is not true you believe that but it's hard for you but it's hard for you to see that people back back then in Germany think about being in Germany in the 1930s or 40s having a terrible economic crisis you're broke you're poor and you know you you your ego needs something to blame because of you being broke or poor you need this leader is telling you to blame a certain group of people as to why your situation is that way and that's what they did and they felt they fell into that propaganda because it it just it felt good it felt right so you didn't live back in those times so you want to know how you would have acted you only know what you know now you don't know what you would have been doing you don't know what kind of person you would have been back in the 40s I mean now you have an iPhone and all that then they didn't have I mean it was just a completely different time and think about being a Nazi soldier back then right you're probably you probably fit the description of what Hitler is looking for as an ideal person he probably pays you well and even and thoroughly even if you disagreed with you with what he was saying he has this big army they'll just kill you if you talk bad about Hitler he will just end you just like that you don't mean generals he probably got rid of just cuz they spoke ill of him or they disagreed with some of his plans I mean that's just that's just how egotistical and ego driven he was so you may be asking how I know you know you may be asking okay I know Hitler was like this totalitarian leader and insanely you know he has crazy ideologies but how does that relate to people nowadays like how do I spot ego in people nowadays again ego is just a sense of self and helps how someone views themselves if somebody is constantly so enthralled in who they are and they always have a need to share their perspective on things and never listen to other perspectives or learn or just grow in any way you're looking at someone that's in their ego another way is also people that are very emotionally tied to their beliefs if your emotion your belief so you want to look at that and ask yourself why you're so emotionally tied to your beliefs does it make you feel good is it are you feel do you feel threatened if you don't have that belief anymore is it something you grew up with think about that I'm not saying ego is bad ego is ego it helps I mean when I'm playing sports my ego isn't tied to it but it comes out in in competition and I want to win and be the best but I understand that there's there's a cap that you have when you're always in your ego if you're always in your ego there's you're gonna fall into arrogance and you're gonna always think that you know everything and that you can't there's nothing else for you you just you just have it all and that just is the opposite of self-improvement that's the opposite of self-development  so that's ego your sense of self we think you are your self image and understand that it has been constructed as you've gotten older and older and older it's been constructed because if you were to grow up in a different area it would change and it would shift right it's not something that you weren't born you with you were you were named right you were named you were you were put into a certain culture into a certain way of thinking.</p>
