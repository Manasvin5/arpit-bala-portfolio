        <h1>Tao P1</h1>
        <p>Those who have known - not through words, not through scriptures, but through life itself, by living it - Lao
            Tzu is one of those few. And those who have not only known, but have also tirelessly tried to make others
            know - Lao Tzu is one of those even fewer.</p>
        <p>But even those who have known and those who have tried to make others know, their primary experience is that
            what can be said is not the truth; that which can take the form of speech inevitably loses its formless
            essence when it takes form. It is like painting the sky: the sky can never be painted; whatever is painted
            in the picture is certainly not the sky. The sky is that which surrounds everything; the picture will not be
            able to surround anything. The picture itself is surrounded by the sky.</p>
        <p>The sky of a painting will be lifeless; it will only be called a sky, just a name, a mere sky.</p>
        <p>Whoever sets out to speak the truth faces the greatest difficulty at the very first step: that the truth
            becomes a lie as soon as it is put into words. It becomes something other than what it is. And what was
            meant to be said remains unsaid. And what was not meant to be said is spoken aloud.</p>
        <p>The Tao is like a path where a bird flies in the sky; as it flies, the path is created, but it is not created
            bound. Footprints are formed on all paths, making it easier for those who come after. The Tao is like a path
            where birds fly in the sky; there are no marks of their feet, and there is no convenience for those who come
            after.</p>
        <p>The Tao is such a path that one can reach the destination standing at the same place, in the same spot.
            Therefore, the Tao cannot be called a path either. If we can reach the destination from where we stand, from
            the place, from the spot where we are; and it may also happen that we walk for births and births, and the
            destination is not reached; then the Tao must be a different kind of path. So one meaning of the path is
            somewhere deep, but with many conditions.

            Another meaning of Tao is: Dharma. But Dharma does not mean religion. Dharma does not mean religion. Dharma
            has the same meaning as the ancient sages took. Dharma means: the rule that holds everything together. The
            ultimate rule, The Ultimate Law, the last law that holds life wherever it is. So Tao is Dharma - not in the
            sense of religion, not in the sense of Islam and Hindu and Jain and Buddhist and Sikh - the ultimate rule of
            life. Dharma is, in the sense of the eternal rule of life.</p>
        <p>But all rules are limited. The Tao is a rule that has no limits.

            In fact, the only limit is death; life has no limit. Dead things are limited; living things are not limited,
            they are infinite. The meaning of life is: the constant capacity for expansion, The Capacity to Expand. A
            seed is alive if it can sprout. A sprout is alive if it can become a tree. A tree is alive if it can have
            more sprouts and seeds. Where the capacity for expansion stops, life stops. That is why a child is more
            alive than an old man; there is still a lot of capacity for expansion.</p>

        <p>So if we say any one word - this is the Tao, this is the path, this is dharma, this is rita - something is
            left behind as soon as we say it. Let's say, the rule. As soon as we say the rule, anarchy is left behind.
            But that is also there in life. As soon as we say the rule, that which is anarchic, that which is chaotic,
            is left behind.</p>
        <p>Nietzsche wrote that how will new stars be created if there is no chaos? How will new creation happen if
            there is no chaos? Because creation is born from chaos. Out of chaos is creation.</p>
        <p>Tao says in this first statement "The Tao that can be trodden is not the enduring and unchanging Tao. The
            name that can be named is not the eternal and unchanging name."</p>
        <p>He says two things. It is not eternal. In fact, any path we can walk on will be our own creation. It will be
            our own creation, so it will not be eternal. It will be man-made, so it will not be God-made. And how will
            the path we have created lead us to truth? Because if we knew the address of the house of truth, we would
            also make a path that leads to truth.

            Remember, a path can only be made when the destination is known. If I know your address, I can make a path
            to it. But this is a very difficult thing. If I know your address, I will have reached your house without a
            path. Otherwise, how did I find out your address?</p>

        <p>Part of the sayings of the old Sufis of Egypt says that when you find God and recognize him, you will surely
            say, "Oh, I already knew you!" And if you cannot say that, how can you recognize God? Recognition is
            impossible. That is what recognition means. If God comes before me and I stand up and ask him who he is,
            then I will not be able to recognize him. And if I recognized the Lord as soon as I saw him, it means that I
            had gone at some moment, from some corner, from some door; recognized today. This is recognition. We can
            only recognize what we know.

        </p>
        <p>If you already know where the truth is, where is the need for a path for you? You have already reached truth,
            you have already known it. So the one who knows does not make a path. And the one who does not know makes a
            path. And how can the paths created by those who do not know reach? They cannot be the eternal path.

        </p>
        <p>Which is the eternal path?--

            The one that man has never created. The one that existed when man did not exist. And the one that will exist when man will no longer exist.</p>

        <p>Even when we were not, it existed. Even when there was no one, it existed. When this earth was forming and there was no life on it, it existed. And when this earth will perish and life will be dissolved, it will still exist. Like the sky, it has always been present.

            It is another matter that our wings were not strong enough for us to fly in it yesterday; today we can fly. It is another matter that even today we cannot gather our courage and sit on the edge of our nest, weighing our wings, and thinking whether to fly or not. But that sky will not be created by your flying. It was there even when your wings were not born, when you were locked inside the egg. And even if you have wings, and you sit and do not fly, it is not that the sky does not exist. The sky exists. The sky exists without you </p>
            
            <p>So the eternal path is the one that exists without the one who walks it. If the path is dependent on the one who walks it, then it is not eternal.</p>
            <p>Is There a Path That Cannot Be Traversed?
                Is there a path that cannot be walked upon?
                
                Is there a path that is not traveled, but rather stood upon?
                
                Is there a path that exists for standing?
                
                It may seem contradictory, it may seem upside down. Paths are meant for walking, not for standing. But the Tao is the name of the path that does not lead by walking, but by stopping. But since people have arrived by stopping, it is called a path. And since people have not arrived anywhere in the world by running and running, it can only be called a path in name only. It is not a path.</p>
            <p>I have heard a story that is 
                Emperor Wu stands before Bodhidharma and asks him to speak about the relationship with that holy and supreme truth. Bodhidharma responds by saying, "What holiness? Nothing is holy! Nothing is ultimate! What supreme truth? There is nothing but emptiness. Besides emptiness, there is nothing."
                
                Naturally, Emperor Wu is surprised and asks Bodhidharma, "Then may I inquire who is standing before me speaking?" Bodhidharma replies, "I do not know. I do not know who this is standing before you speaking. I do not know."
                
                Emperor Wu thinks the man is mad and says, "You don't even know who you are?" Bodhidharma responds, "Before realizing, I knew nothing. Since realizing, I cannot even say I know, because naming and identifying anything we recognize is also just a name."</p>


            <p>If you can say that I remembered the Lord at five o'clock for five minutes, then remember, this worthless prayer will not transcend time. That which was called upon within time will conclude  within time. And the Lord is beyond time. Why? Because within time, there is only change, and the Supreme Being is changeless.</p>
